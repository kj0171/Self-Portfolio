              My role in this project was to do a POC on the Azure digital twin. A hospital room which had beds and sensors was represented in a Digital Twin. The sensor data was 
              simulated using a python script and was ingested in Azure digital twin from which it was flowing to Azure time series insights via event hub.

              My role in this project was to learn the technology and to build the MVP for the private preview release from scratch. Via the extension one can deploy the
              supply chain workspace by calling the Supply Chain Resource Provider. Also, CRUD for other features like data pipelines, datasets, linked services and applications were
              also developed and delivered. Wrappers over control plane and data plane calls were written which would help to develop the future features at a faster pace in future.

              to supply chain's ADLS account, known as ingestion. The data was partitioned and ingested into the supply chain's ADLS. The data could be exported out from supply chain's ADLS account to
              partner's ADLS account. Both operations were carried out using a Pyspark script which was hosted in the Azure Synapse Analytics. On top of export, filtering capabilities were built which helped
              the customer to export data based on ingestions (Ingestion Based Filtering) and schema of the data ( Schema Based Filtering).

              My role in this project was to do learn and implement distributed tracing for the blackbuck infrastructure. A zipkin server was hosted ,applications based on Node JS, a custom middleware was introduced which 
              reported data to the zipkin server and for the java applications, spring sleuth was introduced which is wrapper for brave library used to report data to the zipkin server. Every request was tagged with a unique 
              request id and same was logged. A developer could look into the Kibana for the logs with a crisp request id to trace the complete flow of the request. Elastic search was used as the storage for the requests with
              the retention period marked as 7 days. The other advantage of distributed tracing is one can run a spark job and form the service dependency graph which can help in detecting circular dependency in the system.

               and data will be plotted on the graph. Spring actuator is used to expose the data of the mbean. Based on the data one alerts were setted, helping the team to act on the systems before they go down.

              multiple suppliers , commissioning and marking up the price based on the user (agent) and the supplier. Aerospike was used for uploading special commission
              against certain hotel's and it was kept dynamic. Java Executor service was used for parallel processing of independent tasks. There were
              also many features like Hold And Pay , Pan Verification and Mark up along with the normal flow for the hotel booking.
